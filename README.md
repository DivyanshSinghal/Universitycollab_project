# Innovation Hub
Innovation Hub is a platform for sharing and collaborating on project built by students on a university level.
We are having the goal in mind that this repository's main objective should be achived by the end of October (before the hacktoberfest ends).
You can find the tasks to be completed in the issues section. 
This project is based on pure MERN stack and tailwind css. If you have any kind of doubts regarding the code or the idea, you can join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/wVkfmCZq) and ask about them in the general chat section. 
I hope that everyone collaborating on this project will have a wonderful experience and will collaborate with a motive to help the open source society.
Thanks.
